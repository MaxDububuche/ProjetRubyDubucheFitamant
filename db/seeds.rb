# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#

# Character.create(name: 'hk', rating: 5, price: 10, producer: 'producteur', type:'blonde')
